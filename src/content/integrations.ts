		question: "How long does it take to connect our first source?",

			"Most teams connect their first CRM or support platform in days—not months. Pre-built connectors handle the heavy lifting; our onboarding team maps your fields and governance rules so you're not doing it alone on a weekend.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do we need engineering resources to get started?",
		answer:
			"Usually not for standard connectors. We work with your admins for credentials and permissions, then handle normalization and sync setup. If you have a custom warehouse or internal API, we'll scope that together during onboarding.",
	},
	{
		question: "What if our tool isn't on the list?",
		answer:
			"Tell us what you run. We add connectors based on customer demand and can often stand up a new source faster than teams expect. Send a quick note and we'll come back with a realistic timeline—not a generic 'contact sales.'",
	},
	{
		question: "Is our customer data safe when we connect?",
		answer:
			"Yes. We're ISO 27001 certified, GDPR compliant, and encrypt data in transit and at rest with AES-256 or higher. You control which sources connect, when syncs run, and what stays out of scope. Your data never trains our models.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can we start with one connector and expand later?",
		answer:
			"That's how most teams begin—one CRM or support platform, one AI Agent, one question they already ask every week. Add sources as you trust the answers and want broader coverage across the business.",
	},
	{
		question: "How do connectors affect pricing?",
		answer:
			"Plans scale with conversation volume and the number of integrations you connect—not seats. We'll size the right fit on one call based on your stack and how much customer data you want in scope.",
	},
	{
		question: "What permissions does Answers.cx need?",
		answer:
			"Read access to the customer conversation and CRM data you want analyzed—nothing more than what's required to surface governed insights. We'll walk your InfoSec team through scopes, retention, and pause controls before anything goes live.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can we change or remove a connector later?",
		answer:
			"Absolutely. Your stack evolves; your answer layer should keep up. Add sources when you're ready, pause syncs when you need to, and keep context portable if you switch vendors down the road.",
	},
