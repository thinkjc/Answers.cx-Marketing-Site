		question: "What is The Answer Layer?",

	},
	{
		question: "How is this different from another dashboard?",

	{
		question: "How is this different from a chatbot?",
		answer:
			"It is not a customer-facing chatbot. The Answer Layer reads your operational data and gives your team governed intelligence—briefs, alerts, and on-demand answers. AI Agents monitor and synthesize; they do not talk to your customers unless you build that workflow.",
	},

		question: "Do I need Ask mode and monitoring?",
		answer:
			"Most teams use both from the same layer. Ask when a leader needs a fast answer. Keep AI Agents running to surface what changed before anyone has to go looking for it.",

		question: "Who sees value first?",
		answer:
			"CX and operations leaders who spend nights reconciling exports before executive reviews—typically in the first pilot week, starting with one question they already ask every Monday.",
	},
	{
		question: "How fast can we get started?",
		answer:
			"Most teams connect their first sources in days. We handle integration and mapping; you validate the first answer against what it takes today, then expand briefs, pulse views, and agents as trust builds.",
