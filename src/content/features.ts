		question: "How is this different from another chatbot?",
		answer:
			"Not a chatbot at all. The Answer Layer connects to your operational customer data and gives you governed intelligence—briefs, alerts, and on-demand answers sourced from systems you already trust. AI Agents monitor and synthesize; they don't talk to your customers unless you explicitly build that workflow.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use Ask mode and monitoring at the same time?",
		answer:
			"Yes—and most teams do. Ask ad hoc questions when a leader needs a fast answer, and keep AI Agents running 24/7 to surface what changed before anyone has to go looking for it.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the Daily Brief?",

			"A personalized morning pulse delivered to your inbox or read aloud on your commute. It ranks overnight signals, emerging themes, and decisions worth your attention—built from your connected data, not a generic industry newsletter.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is The Company Pulse?",
		answer:
			"An always-on executive view of customer health—ranking churn risk, revenue signals, product themes, and operational friction as your connected data updates. It's the live pulse of the business, alongside your morning Daily Brief and on-demand Ask mode.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are AI Agents?",
		answer:
			"Specialized AI roles you hire for specific jobs—churn risk, product feedback, compliance monitoring, revenue scouting, and more. Each one watches the sources you connect and produces summaries your team can act on. You choose who's on and when.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are perspective lenses?",
		answer:
			"A way to ask the same question through different leadership frames. The CEO needs a different story than product or CX—and lenses give you both without rebuilding the analysis from scratch.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need to be technical to use it?",
		answer:
			"No. Ask mode is plain language. Daily Briefs arrive ready to read. AI Agents produce human-readable summaries. Your admins help with connector permissions; our onboarding team handles the rest.",
	},
	{
		question: "Will this replace my team?",
		answer:
			"No. The goal is to remove the repetitive work that burns people out—late-night reporting, manual sampling, and endless status hunts. Your team focuses on judgement, relationships, and decisions only humans should make.",
	},
	{
		question: "How fast will we see value?",
		answer:
			"Most teams connect their first sources in days and start with one question they already ask every week. Compare the answer to what it takes today—then expand briefs, agents, and lenses as trust builds.",
